          <h2>Projects and Publications</h2>
          <p>My research journey spans NLP, machine learning, and privacy, tackling challenges from video summarization to differential privacy relaxation. I am developing a multi-source academic summarizer leveraging NLP to analyze videos and text, generating concise summaries and discussion prompts. My work on relaxing differential privacy explored improved privacy guarantees while maintaining model performance, and I developed a novel NLP2SQL approach for efficient database interaction. Along with my academic focus, I explored cancer grading via deep learning and network anomaly detection with optimized ANNs, both published in Springer journals.</p>

              <h4>Prostate Cancer Grading using Multistage Deep Neural Networks</h4>
              <h5>2021</h5>
              <p><em>MIND 2021 • <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-5868-7_21">Springer publication</a></em></p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Developed a novel multi-stage deep learning framework for automated Gleason system grading (GSG) and grade group (GG) classification of prostate cancer cells. This approach differs from existing methods by treating Gleason pattern (GP) classification as a classification problem combined with segmentation.</li>
                  <li>The system achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy exceeding 90% f1-score for each CNN, demonstrating its effectiveness in GSG and GG classification. Additionally, the paper reports precision and recall values for each GP, both exceeding 90%, beating the state-of-the-art techniques.</li>
                  <li>This DL-based system holds promise for enhancing objectivity and efficiency in prostate cancer diagnosis, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.</li>

              <p><em>SSCC 2018 • <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-5826-5_19">Springer publication</a></em></p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Proposed a novel hybrid PSO-DE algorithm that combines Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution to optimize ANNs for network anomaly detection. The hybrid PSO-DE algorithm leverages the complementary advantages of both techniques to achieve better exploration and exploitation capabilities.</li>
                  <li>The optimized ANNs significantly improved anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional methods. The paper reports an accuracy of 98.7%, which significantly improves the accuracy of traditional ANN-based methods.</li>
                  <li>The paper used the NSL-KDD dataset, a standard benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect anomalies in real-world network traffic.</li>
