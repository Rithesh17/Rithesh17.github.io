# Artificial Intelligence Engineering Intern at Accretional

San Francisco, CA 

*June 2024 – August 2024*

Led the development of **Brilliant**, an AI-driven platform that automates end-to-end API generation and deployment using large language models combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

## Key Responsibilities

- Led development of AI-driven platform for automated API generation
- Designed serverless deployment systems
- Investigated and optimized open-source LLMs
- Implemented hybrid semantic search systems

## Major Achievements

### Brilliant Platform Development
- Led the development of **Brilliant**, an AI-driven platform for automated API generation
- Combined large language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Enabled end-to-end API generation and deployment with minimal user intervention

### Serverless Deployment
- Designed systems supporting serverless deployment across **AWS Lambda** and **Google Cloud Functions**
- Enabled scalable, production-ready APIs with minimal user intervention

### LLM Research and Optimization
- Investigated internals of open-source LLMs including **Mistral** and **LLaMA**
