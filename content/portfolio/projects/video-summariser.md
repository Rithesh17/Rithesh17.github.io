# Academic Lecture Video Summariser

An LLM and RAG-based system for summarizing long-form academic videos, making educational content more accessible and digestible.

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of processing and understanding long academic lecture videos by automatically generating comprehensive summaries. The system combines video processing, transcription, and advanced language models to create meaningful summaries.

## Key Features

### Video Processing
- Extracts audio and video content from academic lectures
- Handles various video formats and lengths
- Processes long-form content efficiently

### RAG Integration
- Uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate summarization
- Retrieves relevant context from video transcripts
- Generates summaries that maintain key concepts and structure

### LLM-Powered Summarization
- Leverages large language models for natural summary generation
- Preserves important academic concepts and terminology
- Creates structured summaries with key points and takeaways

## Technical Implementation

The system processes video content, extracts transcripts, and uses RAG to retrieve relevant information before generating summaries with LLMs. This ensures accuracy and relevance in the generated summaries.

## Impact

- Makes long academic lectures more accessible
- Helps students quickly understand key concepts
- Saves time for learners reviewing course material

## Technologies

Python, LLMs, RAG, Video Processing, NLP, Summarization, Transcription
