# CT Denoising and Explainability using OT-CycleGAN

*January 2025 – June 2025*

A research project focused on improving medical imaging quality through advanced deep learning techniques while maintaining clinical interpretability.

## Overview

This project adapts **OT-CycleGAN** (Optimal Transport CycleGAN) for denoising ultra-low-dose CT scans using the IEEE COVID-19 dataset. The work emphasizes both image quality improvement and clinical interpretability through explainability techniques.

## Key Features

### Denoising Architecture
- Adapted **OT-CycleGAN** for medical image denoising
- Trained on ultra-low-dose CT scans from IEEE COVID-19 dataset
- Improved image quality while preserving diagnostic information

### Explainability Integration
- Integrated **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) visualizations
- Implemented attention-based visualizations
- Enhanced clinical interpretability of model decisions

### Evaluation Metrics
- Evaluated denoising performance using **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- Used **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index) metrics
- Validated improvements in image quality through quantitative and qualitative analysis

## Technical Details

The project combines generative adversarial networks with optimal transport theory to create a more stable and effective denoising pipeline. The explainability components help clinicians understand model predictions and build trust in AI-assisted medical imaging.

## Impact

- Improved image quality for ultra-low-dose CT scans
- Enhanced clinical interpretability through explainability features
- Potential for reducing radiation exposure in medical imaging
