# Master of Science in Computer Science

**University of California, Santa Cruz**  
*September 2023 – June 2025*  
**GPA:** 3.9 / 4.0

## Why UC Santa Cruz

I came to UC Santa Cruz to deepen my understanding of machine learning and AI, particularly in medical applications. The program balanced theoretical foundations with practical implementation, which suited how I like to learn—understanding the why behind the what.

## Coursework

The coursework covered advanced machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. What I appreciated most was how the courses connected theory to real problems. In computer vision, for example, we didn't just learn about convolutional networks—we applied them to medical imaging challenges that researchers were actually facing.

The distributed systems course was particularly valuable. Coming from a background focused on ML, I hadn't spent much time thinking about how to build systems that scale. Learning about consensus algorithms, distributed storage, and system design patterns gave me a broader perspective on building production systems.

## Research Focus

My research has focused on medical imaging, specifically CT scan denoising and AI explainability. I've been working on projects that use generative models to improve image quality while maintaining clinical interpretability. The challenge is balancing performance improvements with the need for clinicians to understand and trust the AI's outputs.

I've also been exploring attention mechanisms and how they can be used to make models more interpretable. The goal is to build systems that not only perform well but also provide insights into why they make particular decisions—something that's crucial in medical applications where explainability can be as important as accuracy.

## Academic Performance

The program has been a good mix of structured learning and independent research. I've maintained a 3.9 GPA while also working on projects that have led to publications in peer-reviewed conference proceedings. The balance between coursework and research has let me both build foundational knowledge and explore areas I'm particularly interested in.
