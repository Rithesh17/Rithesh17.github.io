# Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science

**National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal**  
*August 2016 – May 2020*  
**GPA:** 9.4 / 10.0

## Foundation

I did my undergraduate studies at NITK Surathkal, which gave me a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals. The program balanced theory and practice—we learned algorithms and data structures in depth, but also built real projects and worked on research.

## Core Curriculum

The coursework covered the standard CS curriculum: data structures, algorithms, databases, networks, operating systems, and software engineering. What I appreciated was how the courses connected. Learning about operating systems helped me understand how databases work. Understanding networks made distributed systems concepts click. The program built knowledge progressively rather than treating each course as isolated.

## Specialization

Machine learning and AI courses were what really got me interested in the field. I'd done some basic ML projects before, but the formal coursework gave me a deeper understanding of the theory behind the algorithms. Learning about optimization, probability, and linear algebra in the context of ML made the concepts more concrete.

## Research Experience

I also did research during undergrad, working on medical image analysis. I published work on prostate cancer grading using deep neural networks, which was my first experience with research publication. The project involved working with pathologists to understand what features they look for in images, then designing models that could identify similar patterns.

The research experience was valuable because it taught me how to frame research questions, design experiments, and communicate results. It also got me interested in medical AI applications, which I've continued working on in grad school.

## Academic Achievement

Graduating with honors (9.4/10.0 GPA) was nice, but more importantly, the program gave me a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. The combination of rigorous coursework and hands-on projects prepared me well for both industry work and graduate studies.
